This lesson gives an introduction to SageMath. It is ...

The lesson will lead the learner along the path ...

On this path, the learner will became familiar with:

* basic constructions of the programming language,

* ways to find necessary information in the system, and

* good design practices to organise code into complex programs.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> The lesson is oriented on learners possessing the minimal theoretical
> background (at least at the undergraduate level)
> and willing to learn how the concepts from abstract algebra may be
> explored using computational tools.
> No previous experience of working with SageMath is required.
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including home and working directories) and know only how to start SageMath.
