The rest of the lesson should be written as a normal RMarkdown file. You can
include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do.

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to where the
`>` go and where to leave blank lines. You can include code chunks in both the
instructions and solutions. For instance this:

> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
> ~~~
> "a" + "b"
> ~~~
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> >

> > ab
> > ~~~
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
